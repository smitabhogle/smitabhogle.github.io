	<h3>Mobile Application: Personal Record</h3>
	<div class="wrapper">
		<aside class="aside aside-2">
			<p2> Studies have proven that runners' heart rates will sync
				to the music they are listening to, and listening to ill-fitting music can hinder performance. My group decided to develop
				Personal Record, an app targeted towards runners 
				that generates and provide optimal playlists for different types of runs based off a
				user profile. The Minimum Viable Product of Personal Record was to
				produce and display a playlist of songs for the runner based off
				parameters such as age, duration of run, and desired genre of music.
				Our app fufills this by consuming a CVC file of approximately 35,000
				songs. Our app sorts the songs into different groups based off of
				genre and tempo of the song. When the user enters their age into
				their user profile, the app calculates and stores the max heart rate
				of the runner. Personal Record then uses that to calculate the
				predicted heart BPM throughout the run. The algorithm matches a song
				whose average tempo aligns with the runner's estimated heart rate in
				order to produce a optimal playlist for the user. </p2>
