<h1>Apps for Good!</h1>
	<div class="wrapper">
		<aside class="aside aside-1">
			<p> The mission for Apps for Good is to develop an app that can benefit a large group of people.
				A problem that my group identified is that when runners listen to
				music while running, the tempo of the music does not sync to their
				heart's BPM. Studies have proven that runner's heart rates will sync
				to the music they are listening to, so listening to ill fitting
				music can hinder performance. My group decided to develop Personal
				Record, an app targeted towards runners that would generate and
				provide optimal playlists for different types of runs based off a
				user profile.</p>

	<h3>Apps for Good Algorithm</h3>
	<div class="wrapper">
		<aside class="aside aside-2">
			<p>The Minimum Viable Product, MVP, of Personal Record was to
				produce and display a playlist of songs for the runner based off
				parameters such as age, duration of run, and desired genre of music.
				Our app fufills this by consuming a CVC file of approximately 35,000
				songs. Our app sorts the songs into different groups based off of
				genre and tempo of the song. When the user enters their age into
				their user profile, the app calculates and stores the max heart rate
				of the runner. Personal Record then uses that to calculate the
				predicted heart BPM throughout the run. The algorithm matches a song
				whose average tempo aligns with the runner's estimated heart rate in
				order to produce a optimal playlist for the user. Attached to the
				left is our project poster.</p>
