	<h1>STEM II- Assistive Technology</h1>

	<p class="sagebackground">At Mass Academy, the STEM / STW classes
		are taught by Dr. Crowthers. After STEM I was concluded in C Term, we
		began working on our STEM II Projects. We had the opportunity to
		choose our own groups, and work with anyone in our grade. Most groups
		design and manufacture an assistive device for a specific client. My
		group's project was titled "Designing a Mechanized Dog Feeder for
		Wheelchair Users".</p>
